# engineer_recuiting
For the company,well... for the company not that big. they always have to hire someone to help them to do some short time job.
such as sometimes the company want hire someone to help them verify their network system once a week.doing this work just need 1
or two days.but company have pay them a month. cause nobody is willing to be hired 2days per month

For the enginner, sometimes they want to find some short time part-time job.but it's not that easy to goole the the perfect job 
they want to do

so, we developed this platform. this is a O2O platform to let company release their short time recruitment information.and let enginner to searh a part time job. our website also help them contact each other apply jobs,make contract ,retrieval 
recruiment and application information.

we have three different user in this system,which are engineer,company and department

enginner can search jobs by puting different infomation to our systems, and he can apply job and make comment to their employee
after they finish the job.

department can release recruitment info, and retrieval engineer's working status,and department is also responsible for making 
contract with users

company is responsible for creating department ,manage department,deciding if release recruitment info or not, and deal with all
of the things related to money.

you can see more details in the project

at the first, we used CFV in our system, but we mixed CFV and CBV together in the middle. so it's looks a little bit wierd...
but im pretty sure it works well.

as a entry level django-er, it's inevitable to make mistake... and the code maybe not that robust and lose coupling.
if you find any mistake or you have better idea~ you can contact me. i will every appreciate that !!!
